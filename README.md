# Day 1

### Javascript Review
Exercise: (TODO)

### Git & GitHub

*Exercise:*
Visit *(https://learngitbranching.js.org/)[https://learngitbranching.js.org/]* and complete exercises 1, 2, and 3

*Exercise:*
1. Clone the GitHub repository at (TODO)
2. Checkout a new branch called *your_name*
3. Use your IDE to change title of readme to *{your name}â€™s Bootcamp Overview*
4. Stage and commit your changes
5. Push your branch up to the remote

### Package/Dependency Management
(TODO)

### More Javascript

0. What is asynchronocity? Why is it important? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/748175/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-execution-what-does-it-really-mean

Notice what happens with this code:

```javascript
function getGoogle() {
  console.log("A");
  fetch("google.com").then(function(res) {
    console.log("B: I got the website!");
  });
  console.log("C");
}
```

1. What is a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)?
2. What is Promise.all?
3. What is a callback?
4. What is an arrow function? What's different about arrow functions?
5. What is going on here?
   Can you rewrite with function() instead of => ?

```javascript
let addFiveDigits = a => b => c => d => e => a + b + c + d + e;
addFiveDigits(1)(1)(1)(1)(1);
```

6. What are object prototypes?
7. What are higher order components (HOCs)?

### Release 1 (on your own)

0. Write a function that fetches the html from https://www.nytimes.com/ and then writes the return value (which should just be HTML) to the console.
1. Write a function that fetches the HTML from five major news sources all at once, then concatenates the HTML from the sites into one long string. (Hint: Promise.all)
1. Write a function that fetches the HTML from five major news sources all at once and returns the HTML of the webpage that loads first. (Hint: Promise.race)
1. Write a function that fetches the HTML from five major news sources one after the other. Hint:

```javascript
fetch().then(() => {
  fetch().then(() => {
    fetch().then();
  });
});
```

1. For the previous three functions, use [console.time()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/time) to benchmark the speed of all three promises. What do you notice?
1. Write a function that takes as arguments an arbitrary period of time (in milliseconds) and an arbitrary function that it executes after the specified period of time. (This is a callback.)
1. Write a Promise that resolves after 4000 milliseconds.
